# Contributing

The project is pre-release. Prefer a coherent breaking refactor over a compatibility layer that
would preserve a design already known to be wrong.

Use module-first commit messages:

```text
where: imperative summary
```

Examples are `render: require descriptor heap`, `ecs: stabilize workspace ordering`, and
`docs: record startup gates`. Do not require `feat():` Conventional Commit prefixes. Add a concise
body for non-obvious tradeoffs and list the verification commands used.

Hand-written source files are limited to 800 lines by `scripts/check-file-lines.sh`. Generated
protocol bindings and explicit data-heavy fixtures may be excluded only with a documented reason.
Dependency ranges use broad compatible major/minor constraints, never `"*"`.
